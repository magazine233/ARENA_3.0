# Knowing the Graph: Does Relational Structure Improve Linear-Probe Detection of Related AI-Safety Concepts?

*Jason Boudville. — DRAFT SCAFFOLD assembled 2026-06-11, before iteration-4 lands. (Second-model work credited as
"peer replication" throughout — the crediting they requested, confirmed 2026-06-12.)
Everything except §5.4 is determined by completed work; §5.4 has both pre-written outcome variants (legitimate
because the decision rule is locked in `../iteration4_scaling/PREREGISTRATION.md` §3 — we fill in the verdict, we
don't choose it). Numbers verified against the result artifacts named in `PAPER_OUTLINE.md`. Jason: every section
is yours to rewrite in your voice — the scaffold gets the structure, numbers, and bounded claims right.*

## Abstract

Concept-detection probes are a core interpretability tool, and AI-safety concept sets are naturally *relational* —
manipulation, deception, and sycophancy form a graph of siblings, parents, and hubs, not a list of independents. We
test whether knowing that graph improves linear-probe detection of 15 related AI-safety concepts in the residual
stream of Gemma-2-9B (replicated on Gemma-4-E4B). Across four iterations — every powered run pre-registered after
the first — with independent peer replication of every key result, we find a consistent, bounded answer. (1) Relational structure helps **only as local hard-negative
contrast**: training a concept's probe with its directly-related siblings as negatives improves discrimination by
~+0.06 F1, replicated across both models and both codebases — but roughly one third of that effect is shared
vocabulary, not deep structure. (2) The graph's *connectivity* shows no usable signal in the completed
runs: the held-out-edge test (can the other relationships reconstruct a withheld boundary?) yields ΔF1 ≈ +0.01 —
slightly positive but small and unreliable — at every layer, both models, and every data volume: a pre-registered,
within-model 10× scaling sweep (to 70 definitions/context) confirms the flat line — top-volume mean +0.005 with a
95% CI spanning zero, against a shown minimum detectable effect of 0.014 — so this graph's connectivity adds
nothing at any volume we could buy. We explain both results
with a boundary-coverage model in which positives sharpen a concept's centroid while *independent* contrastive
negatives place its decision-boundary facets — connectivity counts only insofar as it counts independent
constraints, and our graph's alternate paths route through a single hub. The practical payoff is a cost-tiered
recipe for deployable safety lenses: cheap graph-sibling negatives seal the neighbour face, a cheap "other" tier
seals far-out-of-distribution inputs completely, and expensive model-mined confusers are justified only on the
measured off-graph gap, where they cut false positives by 20 points.

## 1. Introduction

- **Why relational concept sets matter for safety probing.** Deployable monitoring wants per-concept lenses over
  families of related behaviours (the SET G manipulation/deception/influence family). The naive hope: relational
  knowledge (an ontology/graph) should make probes better — more data per boundary, structure to generalise along.
- **The specific hypothesis we inherited.** Relationship-aware training improves discrimination, and the
  benefit scales with graph *connectivity* (Menger / vertex-disjoint alternate paths) — if A and B are connected by
  many independent paths, a probe should triangulate their boundary even without direct A-vs-B data.
- **What we did.** Four iterations; after iteration 1's false positive, every powered run was pre-registered
  before execution, with adversarial verification of every positive result; an independent peer replication and
  extension — by the hypothesis's originator — on a second model. The result is a *bounded* claim with an
  explanatory model, not a yes/no.
- **Contributions** (foregrounding what the process earned):
  1. A valid, powered, pre-registered test of the relational hypothesis — fixing iteration-1's validity and power
     errors rather than publishing them.
  2. The controls that bound the surviving effect — vocabulary regression (~⅓ lexical), placebo-graph permutation
     (declared graph is special, p=0.002) — and the pre-registered scaling sweep of the peer replication's held-out-edge condition
     (the test that isolates connectivity from adjacency).
  3. Cross-model convergence under peer replication: Gemma-2-9B (this work) and Gemma-4-E4B (peer replication),
     two codebases, same numbers to two decimal places.
  4. A reframing — from vertex connectivity to independent-constraint boundary coverage — that predicts the full
     pattern of results, plus its deployment corollary (the tiered-negatives recipe and the rejection scaffold).

## 2. Background & setup

- **Concept set & graph.** SET G: 15 AI-safety concepts (manipulation/deception/influence family), curated
  relational graph `SET_G_N15_graph_contrastive_boundary_v1` (26 rationalised edges). Concepts defined by
  one-sentence definitions; passages generated by Claude across 4 surface-distinct contexts (workplace, online,
  relationships, marketplace) so probes are evaluated out-of-distribution (train on 3 contexts, test on the held-out
  one) — the v1 lesson: without the OOD split, surface vocabulary saturates everything (AUC ~1.0).
- **Probing.** Mean-pooled residual stream, layer 18 (Gemma-2-9B, d=3584; E4B analogue = hidden_states[19]); logistic
  regression one-vs-rest / pairwise probes; 30 seeds. Layer-18 choice later validated by a 42-layer sweep (§6.2).
- **Menger framing.** Vertex connectivity k(A,B) = number of vertex-disjoint paths; the hypothesis predicts probe
  benefit increases with k.
- **Collaboration & discipline.** Jason leads the iterations and the paper; the study is independently replicated
  and extended on E4B (credited throughout as the peer replication, at their request). Norms: pre-register
  before powered runs; adversarially verify positives; bound claims honestly. (Iteration 1's "positive" was a
  noise artifact caught exactly this way.)

## 3. The honest null (iterations 1–2)

- **Iteration 1.** Definitional vs relational probing + Menger correlation, multiclass. Initially read as positive;
  adversarial verification showed a noise-positive (and, in hindsight, the *wrong question* — relations as extra
  positive passages). Lesson logged, design rebuilt.
- **Iteration 2 (R4).** Pair-matched, powered (105 pairs), pre-registered Menger test: **partial Spearman −0.125**
  — a clean, powered NULL on "connectivity predicts pairwise probe benefit." Decision rule was locked before the
  run; the null is reported as a result, not buried.
- Takeaway carried forward: if relational structure matters, it isn't via *more positive data along the graph*.

## 4. The reframe: relations as hard negatives, and iteration 3 / Path 2

- **The peer replication's diagnosis.** The capstone operationalised "knowing the relations" as extra *positives*; the
  hypothesis's actual mechanism uses related concepts as *hard negatives* — contrast, not coverage.
- **Iteration 3 / Path 2 (pre-registered, Gemma-2-9B).** Declared siblings ARE more confusable than non-siblings —
  placebo-graph permutation p=0.002 (the curated graph is special, not an artifact of having *a* graph); clean
  primary effect **+0.055 F1** (Experiment A, the sibling-vs-random confusability gap; the in-distribution
  training-benefit variant is larger but inflated); vocabulary regression attributes **~⅓** of the effect to
  lexical overlap (an upper bound on the lexical share — the regression over-controls, since vocabulary partly
  mediates relatedness); the graph-beyond-vocabulary residual is positive but marginal.
- **Cross-model convergence.** The peer replication's graph-contrastive test on E4B (their design and first run, 30 seeds):
  direct-neighbour negatives **+0.057**, graph-aware mixed **+0.043**, held-out-edge **+0.008**. Our Gemma-2-9B
  baseline at 14/context reproduces it: **+0.059 / +0.039 / +0.012**. Same pattern, two models, two codebases.

## 5. Connectivity isolated: the held-out-edge test and the scaling sweep

### 5.1 The negative-set design (four conditions)
Per directed edge (target → held-out sibling): train the target's probe with negatives drawn as (a) count-matched
random non-graph concepts, (b) direct neighbours, (c) graph-aware mixed, (d) **graph-aware excluding the evaluated
sibling** (held-out-edge) — the clean alternate-path/Menger condition: if connectivity carries transferable signal,
the *other* relationships should partially reconstruct the withheld boundary.

### 5.2 The local effect is real; the connectivity effect is ≈0
Direct ~+0.06, mixed ~+0.04, held-out-edge ~+0.01 (both models, Section 4 numbers). The benefit ordering follows
proximity to the tested boundary, not path count.

### 5.3 Robustness (peer-replication extensions)
- **Layer sweep:** the deltas reproduce at layers 8/18/24/42; discrimination is near-ceiling at *every* layer
  (lexical separability from the embedding layer up); held-out-edge is dead at every depth. Layer 18 is
  representative, not cherry-picked.
- **4× volume (E4B, 28/context):** held-out-edge mean flat (+0.008 → +0.010); the std of paired deltas tightens
  (0.106 → 0.065) — scale buys *reliability*, not magnitude; held-out-edge positive in only ~40% of comparisons.

### 5.4 Iteration 4: the powered scaling sweep — result: NULL under the locked rule

Pre-registered (LOCKED 2026-06-10): Gemma-2-9B, volumes {7, 14, 28, 56, 70}/context subsampled from a single
70/context (10×) generation+extraction (4,200 passages, blind-audit self-match 95%); primary endpoint =
held-out-edge ΔF1 vs volume; decision rule locked. Run 2026-06-12, 30 seeds.

**Result — NULL, the strong outcome.** Held-out-edge ΔF1 by volume: **+0.008, +0.012, +0.009, +0.005, +0.005** —
no monotonic rise (the curve *declines* past 14/context). At the top volume, paired across the 52 directed edges:
mean **+0.0046, 95% CI [−0.0053, +0.0144]**, paired-t p=0.36, Wilcoxon p=0.78 — the CI spans zero, the locked NULL
criterion. **Power is shown, not asserted:** the minimum detectable effect at 80% power was **ΔF1 = 0.014**, and
the same instrument detects the direct-neighbour effect at the same volume at ~3× that size (+0.040, CI [+0.021,
+0.059], p=0.0001). The alternate-path / Menger prediction — hop-count as the proxy, on this graph — is refuted at
adequate power: relational benefit is local direct-neighbour contrast only. This converges with the independent 4×
E4B peer replication (+0.010, flat) and completes the arc opened by the iteration-2 null — the two nulls and the
bounded positive are one consistent picture under §6.1's model.

**Vocabulary regression at scale (pre-reg §4).** The gross held-out-edge result is ≈0, and shared vocabulary among
graph-relatives could only have *contributed positively* to reconstructing the withheld boundary — so the
net-of-vocabulary reading is a fortiori ≈0. (The full regression on the scaled data is deferred; the a-fortiori
direction makes it non-load-bearing for the null.)

**Sanity (pre-declared secondary, never the headline):** direct-neighbour delta stays clearly positive at every
volume ✓ — but **declines with volume** (+0.061 → +0.040 from 7 to 70/context). The marginal value of relational
negatives is largest in the low-data regime — which is the realistic regime for long-tail safety concepts — exactly
as the boundary-coverage model predicts (volume improves the random-negative baseline, shrinking the premium on
smart negative selection).

## 6. Why: from vertex connectivity to independent-constraint boundary coverage

### 6.1 The model (from the peer replication; REPLICATION_WRITEUP §6)
A concept = centroid + class-conditional distribution; the probe's decision boundary sits at the tail-off.
**Positives sharpen the centroid; independent negatives place boundary facets.** This predicts: extra positives do
nothing once the centroid saturates (iterations 1–2 null); sibling negatives move the boundary (+0.06, iteration 3);
benefit ordering = proximity to the tested facet (direct > mixed > held-out); and held-out-edge ≈ 0 *here* because
SET G's nominally disjoint alternate paths route through the ManipulativeCommunication hub — correlated, not
independent, constraints. **k counts only insofar as it counts independent constraints.**

### 6.2 The geometry is consistent (with an anisotropy correction) [peer replication]
Raw cosine said "everything overlaps" (adjacent 0.971 vs non-adjacent 0.961) — an anisotropy artifact (random
passage pairs sit at ~0.89). Mean-centred: adjacent pairs separate (+0.166), far-domain controls sit clearly
outside (−0.147), but *graded* graph distance still doesn't track representation (r ≈ −0.30 at layer 18; −0.27 to
−0.40 across all 42 layers). The geometry independently reproduces the probe story: local adjacency real, multi-hop
structure absent. Probe results are unaffected (a linear classifier factors out the common direction).

### 6.3 Generation mode is a non-factor (Path 3 first run) [peer replication]
True autoregressive states vs teacher-forced re-reads: graduation pass rates 0.692 vs 0.693 (causal equivalence);
the read-own gap (0.454) is prompt-grounding, not a generation effect. The contrast-*prompted* generation variant
("write A in a way that is not B") remains untested — flagged as future work, since Path 2 shows the
contrast-as-negative mechanism is the one that works.

## 7. The deployment payoff: rejection scaffolds and tiered negatives

*(The two-level probe, multi-scale negatives, and confuser-coverage results in the first three bullets are
peer-replication extensions; the near-OOS control set in the last bullet is this work.)*

- **The flat probe's real failure is missing rejection, not resolution.** A 15-way argmax assigns 100% of
  far-domain inputs to *some* concept; a confidence threshold rejects only 26% of them. A coarse OTHER class
  (trained on cheap far-domain controls) rejects out-of-family inputs at recall 1.0 with 0% false rejection — and
  hierarchical *classification* is the wrong fix (flat 0.910 > soft 0.857 > hard 0.850): the scaffold is for
  rejection, the flat lens for resolution.
- **You seal the faces you train against.** With negative count fixed, FPR@95%TPR by face: graph-sibling negatives
  seal neighbours (0.192 → 0.046) but are *no better than random* on off-graph confusers (0.257 vs 0.270);
  model-mined confusers seal that face (→ 0.058, a 20-point cut) but abandon the others; a cheap "other" tier seals
  far-OOD completely (→ 0.000). The graph misses the hub-attractor confusions (a majority — 24/42, a small base —
  of actual misclassifications fall on non-edges; the robust pattern is the shape, not the number).
- **The recipe:** cheap tiers everywhere (graph siblings + "other"), a cheap audit to locate the off-graph gap,
  expensive mining only on that gap. Calibration drift is a live failure mode (thresholds set on train positives
  collapsed to 34% held-out TPR).
- **Near-OOS controls (this work, for the next test).** The far controls are the easy rejection regime; we
  generated and blind-audited the hard one — legitimate-influence concepts adjacent to the family (Negotiation,
  Advertising, Lobbying; 84 passages, 84/84 blind self-match, zero in-set drift) — with the PersuasiveCommunication
  lens analytically quarantined (its own training set contains honest ads; firing there is a true positive by
  construction). The analysis is pre-committed: the rejection test runs over the other 14 lenses, with FPR reported
  both pooled and split by whether a row's context was held out of the scoring lens's training fold.

## 8. Synthesis & conclusion

Relational structure, for safety probing, is worth exactly this much: **direct relations make the best cheap hard
negatives** (+0.06, ~⅓ lexical, two models, independently replicated) — **and nothing more flows through this
graph's connectivity at any volume we tested** (10× pre-registered sweep: top-volume CI spans zero against a shown
MDE of 0.014). The deeper role of relationships is not classification at all: under the
boundary-coverage model they are *navigation* — the edges along which a coverage-expansion loop would explore from
mapped concepts toward the model's actual confusers (the cartography framing). A negative result, honestly bounded,
plus a mechanism that predicts it, plus a deployment recipe it licenses.

## 9. Methods (the rigor section)

Pre-registration before every powered run after iteration 1 (R4, Path 2, iteration 4 — all locked with decision
rules); F1 as the pre-registered primary metric throughout (balanced accuracy and AUC give the same ordering in
every table; AUC is the most ceiling-compressed);
out-of-distribution evaluation via held-out contexts; controls: count-matched negatives, placebo-graph permutation,
vocabulary regression, held-out-edge isolation, anisotropy-corrected geometry; adversarial verification of every
positive (multi-agent refutation passes; iteration 1's noise-positive caught this way); cross-model independent
replication; all data, code, and result JSONs committed with provenance.

## Acknowledgements

The second-model results throughout are an independent **peer replication** — the crediting requested by the
researcher who performed it (confirmed 2026-06-12). We thank them for the hard-negative reframe, the E4B
replication, the layer/anisotropy/two-level/multi-scale extensions, and the boundary-coverage model. The shared
repository records the full provenance of each result.

## 10. Limitations & future work

- Single concept family (SET G manipulation/deception cluster); single probe family (linear/logistic; MLP spot-checks);
  curated human graph (though §6.2 shows its local layer is model-real).
- Near-ceiling discrimination compresses headroom for *any* manipulation — deltas are small by construction; the
  FPR@95%TPR operating-point analysis (§7) is the sensitive instrument, not pairwise AUC.
- Untested: contrast-prompted self-generation (Path 3 graph-aware variant) feeding a graduation loop; the
  near-but-out-of-set rejection test (controls now generated, §7); the topology retest counting *independent*
  constraints rather than raw k; activation-cell cartography (dark-region discovery) as the principled
  coverage-expansion loop.
